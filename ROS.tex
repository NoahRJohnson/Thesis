\section{Arduino Repeater Node} \label{RepeaterNode}
Adjust code for conversion of ultrasonic sensor ping times to distance, to take into account the ambient air temperature
If an echo has been received, then the speed of sound in air in m/s, \(C_{air}\), is calculated using the current air temperature in Celsius \(T_C\):
\[C_{air} = 331.5 + (0.6 * T_C)*\]

Multiplying \(C_{air}\) by the duration of the timed output pulse gives the estimated distance of the first object in front of the sensor.

Differential drive (skid steering)
wheels can slip
 (high covariance?)


\section{robot\_localization package}
odometry estimate from wheel encoders


\cite{robot_localization_paper}

\section{Results}
results of state estimation / sensor fusion test in parking lot
