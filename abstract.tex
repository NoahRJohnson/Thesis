In this thesis, I designed and constructed an unmanned ground vehicle for the purpose of autonomous navigation. Costs were minimized by reusing components already on-hand wherever possible. While the ultimate goal of autonomous navigation was not reached, I did succeed in both creating a drivable mobile base and fusing sensor data into an odometry estimate within the ROS framework, which is a good foundation for future extension to autonomous navigation.

The rover base consists of a Lynxmotion rover, an Arduino, and a Sabertooth motor driver. Sensors available include two quadrature rotary encoders, a mobile phone, and an ultrasonic distance sensor. The Arduino acts as a low-level robotic controller, publishing wheel encoder and range data, and accepting motor velocity commands. An Android app publishes IMU and GPS data from the mobile phone, and the laptop fuses these readings into a state estimation of pose and velocity using an extended Kalman filter.
