Autonomous navigation is an important emerging technology with applications in warehouse automation, shipping, and  personal navigation. Hands on experimentation often proves too expensive for individuals at the undergraduate level, with common research platform costing several thousand dollars. In this thesis, I present a design for a cheap ground vehicle capable of fusing sensor data into a local state estimate. Costs were minimized by using personal components owned by most students, namely a personal laptop and smartphone. This should be an effective base for research into autonomous navigation.
